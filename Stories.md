## Stories
This program will take in the coefficient values _a_, _b_, and _c_ from a quadratic equation. It will then process and print out the roots _x1_ and _x2_. Along with this, it will watch out for special conditions such as when _a = 0_, when the roots are imaginary, and when there's one unique root. The program wil run using a command-line interface and will be programmed using the C language.


#### Create a program to test user input
##### Risks: Low
##### Time: 1 Hour
##### Tests: Test for Buffer overflows, Scan F tests, Out-put tests


#### Have the program check for special cases such as imaginary roots or if there is only one root
##### Risks: Low
##### Time: 2 Hours
##### Tests: Scan F tests

#### Check for numerical input (From string array)
